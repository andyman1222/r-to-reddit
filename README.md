# r to reddit
A really simple and light bot which will link you to any subreddit or Reddit user mentioned in /r/ form.

## Usage

This bot comes with no prefix. Rather, if you want to link to a subreddit or reddit user, simply mention it/them like you would on Reddit (ex: /r/prequelmemes).

If you find this bot annoying, simply remove it. If you want it to do more, feel free to pull(?) the source or ask me via DM or something. (no guarantee I will add the feature)

### Running

1. install node js/npm
2. `npm install discord.js`
3. cd into source dir
4. edit `config.json` with appropriate bot info
5. `node app.js`
